For each of the following programs, modify them to
have a direct (i.e., specialized or overloaded
implementation) of determinants for 2x2 matrices.
⚫ Matrix
⚫ PSMatrix
⚫ OverloadMatrix
⚫ The formula for the determinant of the 2x2 matrix m
is
m(0,0)*m(1,1) – m(1,0)*m(0,1)
⚫ Test how much your code changed the execution
time for the programs. What do you conclude?
