All of the original files were saved as O_<original name>. The tests were conducted by using the following CL build and 
run commands:

# Matrix (old & new)
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 Matrix.cpp -o Matrix_new
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 O_Matrix.cpp -o Matrix_old

# PSMatrix 
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 PSMatrix.cpp -o PSMatrix_new
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 O_PSMatrix.cpp -o PSMatrix_old

# OverloadMatrix 
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 OverloadMatrix.cpp -o OverloadMatrix_new
g++ -O3 -std=c++20 O_OverloadMatrix.cpp -o OverloadMatrix_old

for i in {1..7}; do ./PSMatrix_old; done
for i in {1..7}; do ./PSMatrix_new; done

for i in {1..7}; do ./OverloadMatrix_old; done
for i in {1..7}; do ./OverloadMatrix_new; done


Here are the results:

Matrix old Average:
0.370917 seconds

Matrix old Median:
0.370917 seconds

Matrix new Average:
0.347604 seconds

Matrix new Median:
0.347604 seconds

PSMatrix old Average:
0.347798 seconds

PSMatrix old Median:
0.345213 seconds

PSMatrix new Average:
0.346383 seconds

PSMatrix new Median:
0.344705 seconds

OverloadMatrix old Average:
0.354081 seconds

OverloadMatrix old Median:
0.348300 seconds

OverloadMatrix new Average:
0.349153 seconds

OverloadMatrix new Median:
0.348017 seconds




Conclusions:
The standard Matrix implementations exhibited a modest performance benefit after introducing a 2x2 matrix determinant, 
with a reduction in execution time of only a few miliseconds. In constrast, the PSMatrix and OverloadMatrix 
implementations showed only marginal performance benefits, with differences at or below the milisecond level. These
results suggest that while direct 2x2 determinant implementations can reduce overhead, their overall impact is limited
and does not significantly impact the total runtime. As expected, the asymptotic time complexity of the operation
remains the same regardless of the determinant implementation or algorithm.
