Since the std::for_each function works by passing the UnaryFunction by value (rather than by reference),
the function does not actually modify maxf in place but actually returns a modified copy of maxf using
the overloaded constructor "()" operation. I was able to fix this program by simply storing the returned
copy of fmax as fmax. Therefore, this for_each line would repeatedly call the overloaded operator() on
the items within the range of names from beginning to end, and end up with the maxLen as the max number
of characters in any of the strings in names.
